# Minimum score to survive: Langhan, Who else?

# Max practical score before ROSC becomes common: Langhan, who else?

# Mean initial ETCO2 for non-survivors = 14
# Mean ETCO2 after 20 minutes for non-survivors = 7
# Starting value above 16 makes for much easier recovery

# Compression depth above 50 >> depth between 39 and 50
