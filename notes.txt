Pseudocode for algorithms:

1. Setting ideal waveforms

We could use one of the sample files for this. Or we could take the same snippet of code
and paste it lots of times to create a set of perfect compressions at 100 bpm (or 110?)


2. Comparing perfection to the user's rate

Every time a compression hits bottom, we readjust the rate and judge the depth

We're not comparing the two waveforms, just the number/depth of compressions so far

Start with a score of... 100? 50? Will we have any scores other than the ETCO2 score?

Every perfect compression makes up some distance between current level and perfect






3. Creating realistic ETCO2 algorithm

Things I've noticed from the CO2 papers:

--We may want to set different "initial values"; patients who survive start with a score of 18.5 on average, while those who don't start with a score of 10
